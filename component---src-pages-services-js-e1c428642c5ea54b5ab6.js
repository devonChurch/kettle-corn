Search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing all offer pay-per-click listings (PPC) services, with Google being the most prevelant. Your business can buy high ranking, low cost search engine listings in a variety of formats - small, large, text only, image/shopper ads after setting up campaigns and bidding on keywords/phrases at the Google ad auction.\n\nWe can help you start with a strategy focussed on keyword research, linkbuilding, benchmarking and onsite/off-site optimisation.
