  content: `Would your customers recommend you to their family and friends? Do you know what delights them and what displeases them? Or what makes them loyal to your business?

[It's expected that by 2018](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3072017), more than 50 percent of organisations will implement significant business model changes in their efforts to improve customer experience. Customer Experience is breaking down barriers for businesses, with those who implement change finding success.

Customer Experience brings the connection, emotion and engagement of a customer's purchase back full circle to the business. A customer-centric business recognises each individual customer (and their purchase) and what impact that has in the bottom line. Essentially, it is putting the customer first to win loyalty, which will in turn result in better word of mouth and favour with others, to generate more business.

Start capturing feedback using Voice of Customer platforms to better understand where you need to invest more and what you're succeeding at. Through collecting feedback you'll be able to retain great customers, minimize negative feedback and increase love for your brand through engagement.

Talk to us about collecting feedback from your customers now. We'll help script your surveys, choose a great solution that works for you, and set you up so you can focus on providing a great experience.`
