Customer Experience is breaking down barriers for businesses, with those who implement change finding success.\n\nCustomer Experience brings the connection, emotion and engagement of a customer's purchase back full circle to the business. A customer-centric business recognises each individual customer (and their purchase) and what impact that has in the bottom line. Essentially, it is putting the customer first to win loyalty, which will in turn result in better word of mouth and favour with others, to generate more business.\n\nStart capturing feedback using Voice of Customer platforms to better understand where you need to invest more and what you're succeeding at.

But despite the evidence, we know that companies are still not spending enough time on optimisation and testing. A quality customer database and lack of strategy are the biggest roadblocks in the way of creating effective, measurable email marketing campaigns.\n\nIn order to create send successful email campaigns, your brand needs to penetrate a customer's busy lifestyle and stand out in their inbox. Customers respond better to personalised emails and most spend about 10-60 minutes browsing marketing emails during the week.\n\nSo what's going to work best for your business... and where do you start? You'll need to build up your list and decide on your marketing automation platform, then content, segmentation and personalisation, which will boost read and open rates.\n[According to Experian](https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/personal-subject-lines), emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be opened than an email not referencing the person's name.\n\nIn New Zealand, commercial electronic messages are subject to a piece of legislation called the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007.

You need to consider Search Engine Marketing (SEM).\n\nThe easier your website is to find, the more likely you are to generate good quality business.

Then, 76% of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a related business within a day, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase. So what does this mean if you're website doesn't have great SEO and no PPC up and running? Well, someone on their smartphone will need to go through many pages of search results to find you in their moment of need.\n\n**What is SEO (search engine optimisation):** Your website must be search engine friendly in order to be crawled effectively and rank high. Google sets out numerous standards in order to rank high, including quality onpage content, user engagement, being mobile-friendly and site speed. These frequently change in line with industry enhancements.\n\n**What is SEM (search engine marketing):** SEM refers to paid search engine listings that increase the visibility of your business, but is also an all encomapssing term for optimising your website to rank higher. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing all offer pay-per-click listings (PPC) services, with Google being the most prevelant. Your business can buy high ranking, low cost search engine listings in a variety of formats - small, large, text only, image/shopper ads after setting up campaigns and bidding on keywords/phrases at the Google ad auction.\n\nWe can help you start with a strategy focussed on keyword research, linkbuilding, benchmarking and onsite/off-site optimisation.
