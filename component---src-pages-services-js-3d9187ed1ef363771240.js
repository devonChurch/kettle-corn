But despite the evidence, we know that companies are still not spending enough time on optimisation and testing. A quality customer database and lack of strategy are the biggest roadblocks in the way of creating effective, measurable email marketing campaigns.\n\nIn order to create send successful email campaigns, your brand needs to penetrate a customer's busy lifestyle and stand out in their inbox. Customers respond better to personalised emails and most spend about 10-60 minutes browsing marketing emails during the week.\n\nSo what's going to work best for your business... and where do you start?
