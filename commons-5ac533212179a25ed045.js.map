total viewport units (vw) to assign at the 'small' breakpoint which will\n//   represent the minimum 'px' value at that breakpoint and begin the scale to\n//   the maximum value as the browser width increases.\n// + The breakpoint in which the maximum value will be reached (so that we can\n//   STOP scaling the value against the browser width).\n//\n// Formula (A):\n// 600 / 100 = 6 // 6px for

100 * 18 = 1800 // 1800px represents the breakpoint width that would reach the\n//                 // maximum font-size so that we can reassign it to a static\n//                 // value to stop
