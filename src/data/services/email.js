  content: `Building a successful email marketing campaign has never been more important to target the right people, at the right time.

Email marketing presents the most cost effective channel to keep in direct contact with your customers and prospects, and can yield the greatest opportunity to grow your business through conversion (ROI).

Email marketing delivers exactly the message you want to deliver, to customers who have explicitly told you that they want to hear more from you.

[According to Chief Marketer](http://www.chiefmarketer.com/direct-mail-gets-most-response-but-email-has-highest-roi-dma/), email ROI is 28.5% compared to 7% for direct mail. But despite the evidence, we know that companies are still not spending enough time on optimisation and testing. A quality customer database and lack of strategy are the biggest roadblocks in the way of creating effective, measurable email marketing campaigns.

In order to create send successful email campaigns, your brand needs to penetrate a customer's busy lifestyle and stand out in their inbox. Customers respond better to personalised emails and most spend about 10-60 minutes browsing marketing emails during the week.

So what's going to work best for your business... and where do you start? You'll need to build up your list and decide on your marketing automation platform, then content, segmentation and personalisation, which will boost read and open rates.
[According to Experian](https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/personal-subject-lines), emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be opened than an email not referencing the person's name.

In New Zealand, commercial electronic messages are subject to a piece of legislation called the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007. This means you need permission from the recipient before you send them your business emails.
