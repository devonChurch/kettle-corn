The easier your website is to find, the more likely you are to generate good quality business. If your website is not easily searchable, you are closing the door on potentially the biggest source of new leads and growth.

[According to Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-aunz/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-measurement-potential-drive-growth/), 69% of smartphone owners turn to mobile search first. Then, 76% of people who search for something nearby on their smartphone visit a related business within a day, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase. So what does this mean if you're website doesn't have great SEO and no PPC up and running? Well, someone on their smartphone will need to go through many pages of search results to find you in their moment of need.
