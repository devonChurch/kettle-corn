  content: `Need a digital presence for your business to grow e-commerce sales and/or foot traffic to your shop? We can put together a package that suit your needs, whether you're looking for a fully customised website solution or something on the more conservative side.

[According to MBIE](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/business/business-growth-agenda/sectors-reports-series/pdf-image-library/the-small-business-sector-report-and-factsheet/small-business-factsheet-2016.pdf), small businesses dominate industries in New Zealand, with 97% of businesses comprising fewer than 20 employees. But only 69% of businesses have a website in some form.

We take the time to understand your business and digital strategy in order to provide you the most appropriate solution. Whether you require a ground-up build, e-commerce addons so your customers can shop online, copywriting, help with SEO, advertising, or website growth strategies.

We can point you in the right direction and help you achieve the most for your business.
