Customer Experience is breaking down barriers for businesses, with those who implement change finding success.\n\nCustomer Experience brings the connection, emotion and engagement of a customer's purchase back full circle to the business.

Essentially, it is putting the customer first to win loyalty, which will in turn result in better word of mouth and favour with others, to generate more business.\n\nStart capturing feedback using Voice of Customer platforms to better understand where you need to invest more and what you're succeeding at.

Google sets out numerous standards in order to rank high, including quality onpage content, user engagement, being mobile-friendly and site speed. These frequently change in line with industry enhancements.\n\n**What is SEM (search engine marketing):** SEM refers to paid search engine listings that increase the visibility of your business, but is also an all encomapssing term for optimising your website to rank higher. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing all offer pay-per-click listings (PPC) services, with Google being the most prevelant. Your business can buy high ranking, low cost search engine listings in a variety of formats - small, large, text only, image/shopper ads after setting up campaigns and bidding on keywords/phrases at the Google ad auction.\n\nWe can help you start with a strategy focussed on keyword research, linkbuilding, benchmarking and onsite/off-site optimisation.
